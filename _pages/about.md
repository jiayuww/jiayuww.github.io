I am Jiayu (pronounciation: "Jee-ah-y√º Wahng"), a PhD student in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aws Albarghouthi](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Prof. Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). My research interests include large language models, vision-language models, efficient machine learning systems and code generation.
