Welcome! I am Jiayu (pronounciation: "Jee-ah-y√º Wahng"), a final-year master's student in the Economics Department at University of Wisconsin-Madison graduating May 2024. I am currently conducting research with [Prof. Loris D'Antoni](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~loris/) at [MadPL Group](https://madpl.cs.wisc.edu/). My interests include machine learning, program synthesis and data analytics.

**<span style="color: #DAA520;">I am actively seeking full-time positions in data, finance, and quantitative analysis, available to start from May 2024. :)</span>**
