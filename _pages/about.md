I am Jiayu (pronounciation: "Jee-ah-yÃ¼ Wahng"), a fourth-year PhD candidate in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aws Albarghouthi](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Prof. Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/) ([Sprocket Lab](https://sprocketlab.github.io/)). 

I am passionate about **building efficient and intelligent agentic systems**. My recent works focus on:
- Data- and compute-efficient adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) (*e.g.,* [cost-effective adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01449) via augmenting model routing with expanded adaptation strategy pool)
- Reasoning in agentic systems (*e.g.,* [deep research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14240), [dissecting mathematical reasoning under RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04723), [grammar-aligned decoding (logical reasoning)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21047), [spatial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852))

I'm always happy to discuss research, answer questions, or just chat! Feel free to reach out through my socials (see RHS â†’).

Outside of research, I love playing tennisðŸŽ¾ and try to get on the court as often as I canâ€”usually 4â€“5 times a week.
