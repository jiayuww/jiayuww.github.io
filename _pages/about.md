I am Jiayu (pronounciation: "Jee-ah-y√º Wahng"), a PhD student in Computer Sciences at UW-Madison. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Aws Albarghouthi](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Prof. Fred Sala](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fredsala/). 

I am passionate about building efficient and intelligent foundation models. My recent works focus on:
- Data- and compute-efficient machine learning (*e.g.,* LLM routing)
- Logical and mathematical reasoning for LLMs and VLMs (*e.g.,* [grammar-aligned decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21047), [spatial reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852))
