ðŸš€ **COSMOS** preprint is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01449)! With training-time and test-time adaptation strategies for LLMs exploding in number, figuring out the best one can feel like a wild goose chase. COSMOS makes it easy â€” predicting performance and cost accurately and efficiently so you donâ€™t have to burn GPU hours testing every option. Smarter choices, fewer experiments.
