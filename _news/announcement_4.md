I'll be attending NeurIPS 2024 in Vancouver from December 9-14! I'm excited to present two papers:

- [SpatialEval](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/94371): We took a fresh look at how language models and vision-language models handle spatial reasoning. The twist? We tested them on our new benchmark SpatialEval across TQA, VQA, and VTQA. Found some pretty surprising results!
- [GAD](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2024/poster/96599): Ever wondered if constrained decoding changes how LLMs actually behave? We proved it does - and came up with the first solution to fix the distribution distortion problem.

If you're around, I'd love to chat about these or just catch up! Drop by my poster sessions and let's connect!

Can't wait to see everyone in Vancouver! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦
